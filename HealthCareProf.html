	<h3 class="sideHead3">A Guide to Today's Healthcare Professionals</h3>
	<p class="sbCopy">For a routine office visit these days, you might not ever see an M.D. A case of the flu, for example, might be handled by a physician assistant (P.A.), and a regular checkup might be done mainly by a nurse practitioner (N.P.). And that can be just fine: Practices with advanced practice providers have outcomes at least as good as those that rely mainly on M.D.s. But it can be reassuring to know exactly who it is you’re seeing. Here’s a guide to some of the providers and what sets them apart from one another.</p>

	<hr class="Rght">

	<h3 class="sideHead4">MEDICAL DOCTOR (M.D.)</h3>
	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Training: </span>Earning this degree requires four years of medical school—typically with two years studying biomedical science and basic clinical skills—and two more rotating through a broad variety of specialties. Then there’s another three to seven years under the supervision of experienced faculty physicians</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Strengths: </span>M.D.s (and D.O.s; see right) have the most training of the providers you’ll see. So if you have several conditions or symptoms that don’t easily add up, an M.D. can connect the dots more easily, says David Blumenthal, M.D., president of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit foundation that focuses on health policy.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Limitations: </span>Primary-care docs are in short supply, so it might be difficult to find one accepting new patients, and he or she might not be able to spend as much time with you as you like.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">CR’s Advice: </span>If you have a complex health condition or one that isn’t responding to treatment, you’re better off seeing an M.D., says Marvin M. Lipman, M.D., CR’s chief medical adviser. But if you’re in good health or your condition is well-controlled, it can be fine to get the bulk of your care from an advanced practice provider.</p>

	<hr class="Rght">

	<h3 class="sideHead4">DOCTOR OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE (D.O.)</h3>
	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Training: </span>The four years of medical education for D.O.s largely matches M.D. programs but also includes 200 hours in osteopathic manipulative medicine, hands-on techniques designed mainly to treat pain. These doctors participate in many of the same residency programs as M.D.s and can specialize in anything from pediatrics to psychiatry to surgery. One of four U.S. medical students now attends an osteopathic medical school. But don’t confuse D.O.s with osteopathic practitioners who are trained abroad; they’re neither M.D.s nor D.O.s., only perform manipulative treatment, and can’t prescribe medicine.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Strengths: </span>“D.O.s are virtually interchangeable from M.D.s,” says Susan Hingle, M.D., chair of the Board of Regents of the American College of Physicians. They provide a full range of medical care for all types of diseases and health problems, but they may be especially good at treating musculoskeletal conditions such as lower back pain, and less likely to prescribe drugs for that problem, according to a 2015 study in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Limitations: </span>Like M.D.s, they don’t have much time to spend with patients. The average osteopathic visit is actually a couple of minutes shorter than the average visit with an M.D., according to that same 2015 study.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">CR’s Advice: </span>A D.O. can serve as your doctor in any case where you might seek an M.D. More than half of them practice family medicine or pediatrics. And by seeing a D.O., you get the benefit of his or her extra training in the musculoskeletal system.</p>

	<h3 class="sideHead4">NURSE PRACTITIONER (N.P.)</h3>
	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Training: </span>Before someone can become an N.P., he or she must be a registered nurse (R.N.), which requires an undergraduate degree in nursing. N.P.s go on to advanced education and clinical training, earning either a master’s or doctorate degree, specializing in an area such as family practice, pediatrics, or women’s health, says Diane Padden, N.P., Ph.D., vice president of professional practice and partnerships at the American Association of Nurse Practitioners.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Strengths: </span>N.P. education and training emphasize patient-centered care, which means that in addition to diagnosing and treating conditions, N.P.s focus on health education and counseling. One study found that patients tend to be more satisfied after a visit with an N.P., and that those visits tend to be longer. In some states, N.P.s can practice independently.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Limitations: </span>Those with diagnostic dilemmas, such as an unexplained fever that has lasted a few weeks, should usually be referred to an M.D. or a D.O.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">CR’s advice: </span>It’s fine to choose a nurse practitioner as your main healthcare provider and to have one provide routine care during an office visit. But you should expect to be referred to a physician for complicated problems.</p>

	<hr class="Rght">

	<h3 class="sideHead4">PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT (P.A.)</h3>
	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Training: </span>Becoming licensed as a P.A. typically involves a three-year master’s program with coursework in anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, diagnosis, and ethics, as well as training in areas such as family medicine, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and pediatrics. Many P.A. programs also require some sort of patient-care experience, such as working as an EMT, a phlebotomist, or a registered nurse.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Strengths: </span>They can do many of the same things as M.D.s and D.O.s, such as taking medical histories, doing physical exams, ordering X-rays and other tests, and prescribing medication.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Limitations: </span>TP.A.s usually aren’t trained to handle multiple complicated diagnoses or complex procedures on their own. And they can work only under a supervising physician.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">CR’s advice: </span>It’s fine to rely on a P.A. for routine matters, such as a urinary tract infection or sprain, Lipman says. You can also go to them for follow-up visits for such conditions as high blood pressure. But avoid relying on them for complicated procedures.</p>

	<hr class="Rght">

	<h3 class="sideHead4">REGISTERED NURSE (R.N.)</h3>
	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Training: </span>Laws vary by state, but R.N.s generally have a Bachelor of Science degree in nursing, an associate’s degree in nursing, or a diploma from an approved nursing program.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Strengths: </span>R.N.s are vital members of a medical team, taking medical histories, assessing symptoms, and supporting patients. They tend to focus more on patient education, “for example, counseling someone with high blood pressure on how to take their blood pressure at home,” Hingle says. That’s because their training “tends to be a lot more relationship-focused than what doctors get in medical school.”</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">Limitations: </span>R.N.s can’t practice independently or write prescriptions, and they must work under the supervision of an M.D. or a D.O.</p>

	<p class="sbCopy"><span class="sbCopyBld">CR’s advice: </span>You shouldn’t rely on one as a primary-care provider. But R.N.s are a great resource at your doctor’s office if you need diet or lifestyle counseling, or instructions on day-to-day treatment of a disease (such as monitoring blood sugar levels).</p><br>
